# 05-FPS-Maze
A 3-Dimensional, First-person maze created as a project for Game MSCH-C220.

The objective is to reach the opposite corner of the maze. You'll need the key to open the exit, but fortunately, it's not hard to miss. There are turrets that will kill you if you remain in their line of sight for too long, so either stay behind cover or shoot first.

## Implementation

Basic features:  
A controllable player character (with mouse capture),  
A 6x12 handcrafted maze,  
A CSG structure (the gazebo in which the key is found),  
A key to pick up,  
Four turrets that can end the game,  
A main menu, an in-game menu, and an end-game screen,  
A clear objective (get out).

Other features:  
Cool textures for the walls and ground;  
A hitscan shotgun, complete with sound effects, muzzle flash, shot cooldown, and randomized spread;  
Bullet decals on the walls/other objects;  
A targeting system for the turrets;  
Turret sound effects (ambient, alert, lose alert, laser, getting hit, and exploding);  
Key pickup sound effect;  
Funky music.
